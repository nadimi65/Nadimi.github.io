We employ a variety of smart technologies to monitor and enhance agri-food quality throughout the post-harvest process. Our methods include imaging and spectroscopy, which improve the preservation, handling, and quality assessment of crops and their derivatives. Our data analytics capabilities leverage machine learning and deep learning tools to support informed decision-making. Additionally, we are exploring the potential of laser technology in the agri-food sector, focusing on biostimulation to reverse biotic/abiotic stresses in stored crops and improve their viability.
